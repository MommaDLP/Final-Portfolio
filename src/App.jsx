         Hello World! I'm Miranda De La Paz a beginner web developer out of Texas.<br></br>
         As an artist, my first love will always be crafting the visual.<br></br>
         From creating an amazing home life with a family to lines of code on a webpage, <br></br>
         I love combining logic with creative design to make eye catching websites and applications.<br></br>
        <br></br>
         I've just completed UTSA bootcamp and was able to leverage my creative skills with incredible web development tools.<br></br>
         I've always been drawn to both the creative and analytical side of development, <br></br>
         so I'm so thankful to be able to do both with the foundation I built during bootcamp.<br></br>
         I'm now able to truly call myself a Front-End Developer who is currently working to becoming stronger in Back-End developing. <br></br>
         With that technology leads, society follows and I'm excited to make the leap to continue to refine my skills with the right company.<br></br>
      </p>
